            <h3>My Educational Information</h3>
            <p>My educational journey commenced when I was a bright-eyed five-year-old, stepping into the nurturing environment of <a id="txt" href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Green-Bud-Nursery-School-100034571364715/" target="_blank">Green Bud Nursery School</a>. This institution, more than just a school, was my gateway to learning and discovery. It was here, from KG 1 through to class 3, that the seeds of my curiosity and love for learning were sown. This phase of my education, spanning from 2015 to 2018, was marked by a blend of play and study, where each day was a new adventure waiting to unfold.
<br>
<br>
                In 2019, a significant milestone marked my academic journey. I transitioned to <a id="txt" href="https://www.mmodel.edu.bd/" target="_blank">Motijheel Model School & College</a>, a prestigious institution in Dhaka known for its excellence in education and holistic development. This transition wasn't merely a change of schools but a leap into a broader horizon of opportunities and challenges. Entering this renowned school in class 4, I was introduced to a more structured and diverse curriculum that aimed not just at academic excellence but also at molding me into a well-rounded individual.
<br>
<br>
                The progression of years saw me embracing the rigorous academic environment, which was a blend of traditional learning and modern pedagogical methods. Each class, from 4 to my current standing in class 9, has been a stepping stone, adding layers to my understanding and perspectives.
<br>
<br>
                Throughout these years, studying in Bangladesh has offered me a unique perspective on education, blending rich cultural heritage with modern educational practices. It has been a journey of growth, resilience, and continuous learning, shaping me into the individual I am today. As I navigate through Class 9, I look forward to what the future holds, armed with the knowledge that my educational foundation is solid and my potential is limitless.

And from this year I also started learning programming languages.
